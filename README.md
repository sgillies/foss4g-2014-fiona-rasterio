Rasterio: Geospatial Raster Data Access for Programmers and Future Programmers
==============================================================================

Talk for SciPy 2014.

Format: 20 mins + 5 for questions.

There are notes inline. I intend to format them better and incorporate
audience questions and feedback.

# Description

Learn to read, manipulate, and write georeferenced imagery and other kinds of
geospatial raster data using a productive and fun GDAL and Numpy-based library
named Rasterio. Itâ€™s a new open source project from the satellite team at
Mapbox and is informed by a decade of experience using Python and GDAL.  

# Abstract

Rasterio is a GDAL and Numpy-based Python library guided by lessons learned
over a decade of using GDAL and Python to solve geospatial problems. Among
these lessons: the importance of productivity, enjoyability, and serendipity.

I will discuss the motivation for writing Rasterio and explain how and why it
diverges from other GIS software and embraces Python types, protocols, and
idioms. I will also explain why Rasterio adheres to some GIS paradigms and
bends or breaks others.

Finally, I will show examples of using Rasterio to read, manipulate, and write
georeferenced raster data. Some examples will be familiar to users of older
Python GIS software and will illustrate how Rasterio lets you get more done
with less code and fewer bugs. I will also demonstrate fun and useful features
of Rasterio not found in other geospatial libraries.
